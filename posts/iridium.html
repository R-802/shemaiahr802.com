            <h1>Iridium</h1>

            <blockquote><p><em>Iridium was a pilot project designed to test and validate the performance of 3D printed unmanned
                    aerial vehicles (UAV).</em></p></blockquote>

            <h4>Requirements</h4>

            <p>The main objective was to see whether low cost hobby grade FDM based 3D printers and materials
                could be used to produce aircraft with adequate performance for long range autonomous missions.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Capabilities included but were not limited to:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Autonomous flight</strong> - required a flight controller (FC) and some sort of GPS connectivity</li>
                <li><strong>Live Telemetry</strong> - required a telemetry radio or live comms feedback from the FC</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time visual feedback</strong> - required a camera and video transmitter (VTX)</li>
                <li><strong>Return to home (RTH)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Long range communication</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Long battery life</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The above requirements were met by implementation of the following hardware, specs are also listed:</p>

            <ul>

            </ul>

            <p style="color: red;"><em>The complete BOM will be linked <a href="">here</a></em></p>

            <p>Many of the resources and hardware used in this project are chosen not because of its performance but because of its low cost, rigorous use is not recommened. 
                The aircraft in its current state is designed to be disassembled and repurposed, and as such, the hardware is not designed to be used in a production environment. 
                This is project is nothing but a proof of concept (and mostly just for fun).
            </p>

            <h4>Design</h4>

            <p>To achieve long range capabilities I chose to opt for the relatively new high-performance radio
                control link <a href="https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS">ExpressLRS</a> or ELRS for short. Not
                only is the hardware required for implementation low-cost in comparison to that of other
                long range protocols, ELRS also has the added benefit of being open source, therefore constantly
                being updated and improved upon. Hardware support is vast, the community is growing, and
                manufacturers are constantly pumping out new products so the choice was obvious.
            </p>

            <p>Because I didn't want to spend months on this project, I decided against designing an
                aircraft from scratch and instead scoured the internet for a suitable design. I found a few designs that
                I liked, but I ended up with <a href="https://www.eclipson-airplanes.com/ebw-160-uav">Eclipsons EBW-160</a> as it
                was a relatively simple design and had appropriate prerouted channels and fittings for the
                hardware. It was also cut to perfectly fit inside the print dimensions of an Ender 3 pro, which was the
                printer I was working with at the time.
