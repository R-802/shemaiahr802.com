            <h1>Sol - A 1kN Hybrid Rocket Engine</h1>

            <p><em>Sol is a 1 kN hybrid rocket engine designed as prerequisition and validation in accordance with the
                    specifications of an
                    upcoming project, Kuiper.</em></p>

            <p> Hybrid rocket engines have often been glanced over as an
                ineffective means of rocket propulsion and that is true in
                some cases.
                However, in small scale rockets and missiles, Hybrid Engines
                have been used to great success for many years due to their
                significant safety margins
                and when designed well, performance characteristics in
                comparison to that of a solid engines at a similar scale.
                The throttleability and the degree of
                control of a Hybrid Engine is one its largest advantages.
                Being able to stop and start an engine and control its
                thrust output provides the functionality
                of a liquid engine with the form factor of a solid engine,
                Which is extremely useful in small scale applications.
            </p>

            <p> The engine is powered with an HTPB or ABS core and gaseous
                oxygen (GOx), designed for a nominal thrust output
                of 1kN at 300psi chamber pressure.
            </p>

            <p> Due to time and financial constraints, Sol is designed to be
                built with commercially available materials and relatively
                few custom parts. Below is a cross-section
                of the complete engine assembly.
            </p>

            <h2>The Nozzle</h2>
            <p> The nozzle geometry has been the most difficult part of this project so far, as achieving chocked flow
                at low pressure
                while aiming for high thrust output means making a visually displeasing exhaust plume. As a result, I
                have chosen to opt
                for a slightly over-expand the nozzle, which will hopefully provide the optimal enviroment for the
                appearance of mach
                diamonds.
            </p>
            <p> First iterations of the nozzle will be made with an SIC-based refractory concrete as it is relatively
                cheap and easy to
                mold using 3d printed negatives of the geometry. This makes it very easy to prototype and iterate
                quickly. There are
                some drawbacks to using refractory concrete, such as particle ejection and structural stability at long
                periods under
                high load; therefore, later iterations will be machined out of graphite rods.
            </p>

            <h2>The Injector Assembly</h2>
            <p> Current renders of the assembly are out of date and have been redesigned multiple times, particularly
                the SH injector
                hole pattern. However, the general design remains true to the initial idea, and that is a machined
                injector plate bolted
                through the side wall of the combustion chamber, compressed against the oxidizer inlet plate using the
                eight retention
                rods on the outside to hold the injector plate in place. At current design pressures, the plate will
                hold and provide
                good distribution of the oxidizer. However, I'm unsure how well this will hold up at higher pressures.
            </p>

                    Injector assembly" width="700" height="480">
            <p> The rear retention plate will be fitted with two pressure transmitters for redundancy purposes and a
                high temperature
                thermocouple. Although these measurements are not being taken directly inside the combustion chamber, I
                think that
                having sensors on the injector side will provide some valuable insight into how well the injector
                functions during
                operation. I have provided the part diagrams to give you an idea of how the engine is assembled and how
                it will
                function. Note that many issues have been found within the intricacies of this iteration.

            </p>

            <h2>Previous Iterations</h2>
            <p> Although these designs are out of date I think it is
                important to note the progression of the project, as ultimately, the
                knowledge gained is more important than the final result.

                    of the complete assembly" width="700" height="390">
            <p> The very first iteration of the engine was based around a large pneumatic operated actuator and was
                designed to operate
                at 500psi for a nominal thrust output of 1kN. This design was good, however, was unnecessarily expensive
                and would be
                difficult to machine many of the engines main components.
